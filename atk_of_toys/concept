You are hosting a gathering when outside there is a noise, you and your friend/s (1-6) find yourself in an unusual situation where "Toys" have started to take over the 
United States.  You walk outside to see that everything is overrun.  In a stunned silence you walk back in and turn on the TV to find a news channel.

~ This is a special news bulletin.  Toys have taken over and the military can't do anything to stop them.  We are calling for all able bodied people to join the fight.  Anyone who wants to fight there is a pill you can take that will alter you for (x number of turns) to fight these things.  We don't know what adverse side effects the pill wil have but I can assure you, you will be doing your country a great service.  If you want to help you will be dropped into hostile territory where you will need to fend off and gain the upper hand in this territory.  Thank you and good luck.~
