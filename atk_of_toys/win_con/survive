One of your survivors is the designated surviver who has the way to defeat the enemies.  The goal is to protect that person against all harm for 15 of their turns.  This is a race against time.  And it seems like nothing is on your side.  You are surrounded 
and their isn't much that can be done.  All you need to do is survive.


Sounds easy right?......

Wrong.

The survivor has no mase attack and must be protected at all costs.  During the enemy turn all enemies move toward the survivor taking the shortest path.  

During each players turns they must take all of their movement.  The survivor does not
have a weapon and can not obtain one.  He/she has double their life total at the start and can only regain life to the total on their player card.  The survivor can hold on to stimulants that give weapon enhancements and give those enhancements to players within 1 space of that player.

At turn five then enemies get wind of the situation and begin to adjust their strategy.  At turn 5 all players must draw two condomnation cards and play them immediately.
