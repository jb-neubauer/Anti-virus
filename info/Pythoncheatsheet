Python cheat sheet:

If checks first condition
elif checks subsequent conditions
else checks final condition

for variable in list
Do these things 
Ex. 
foods = [‘banana’, ‘oranges’, ‘kiwi’, ‘bread’, ‘juice’]
for f in foods:
	print (f, len(f))

 This will print out the foods in the list foods and print the length of each item

For increments in a for loop use three numbers (starting point, ending point, increment)

while While something is true or false do the action.  Until reaching a stopping point.
Example:
stuff = 20

while stuff < 25:
	print(stuff)
	stuff +=1

This will print 20-24 because the condition of 20- 24 being less than 25

break stops the loop you are currently in

continue continues with the loop if a statement has been fulfilled

Functions

def defines a function
To call a function use the function name
Ex.  
def stuff():
	print (“stuff is stuff”)

stuff ()  <- is calling the function

Example:

def stuff():
	print (“stuff is stuff”)

def bitcoin_to_usd(btc):
	amount = btc * 527
	print(amount)

stuff()
bitcoin_to_usd(4.5)
bitcoin_to_usd(2.5)

return returns a value to a variable that is stored for later use
Ex.
def allowed _dating_age(my_age):
age = my_age /2+7
return age

My_limit = allowed_dating_age(34)
Other_limit = allowed_dating_age(31)
print (“I can date people aged”, My_limit, “or older”)
print (“You can date people aged”, Other_limit, “or older”)

def gender(sex =’Unknown’):
	If sex is ‘m’:
		Sex = ‘Male’
	elif sex is ‘f’:
		sex  ‘Female’
	print sex

gender(‘m’)
gender(‘f’)
gender()

Arguments

def dumb_sentence(name=”Justin”, action=”ate”, item=”sushi”)
	print (name, action, item)

dumb_sentence()
dumb_sentence(“John”, “sighs”, “loudly”)
dumb_sentence(item=”foods”)
dumb_sentence(item=”amazing”, action=”is”)

Output:

Justin ate Sushi
