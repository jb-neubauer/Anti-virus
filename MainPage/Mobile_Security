	With technology always being at the forefront of many companies and individuals there are often
times where Security is overlooked.  None more so then with our mobile devices.  I have heard the saying
its a phone, or it just works.  How true is that?  We use our phone for everything, without thinking 
about it.  We access emails, bank accounts, personal information, and are not sure of how secure our 
device really is, or if it is secure at all.
	Don't just think it is phones that are susceptible to these attacks, everything that uses the 
Android and IOS operating systems can be vulnerable.  These vulnerabilities can lead to liabilities 
that puts your information or a companies information at risk.  Though there is only one real solution 
to this issue, it is impracticle in this age and that would be not to use mobile devices at all.  We 
use our mobile devices as almost an extension of ourselves, and "the world will end" if we lose them, 
or at least that can be the perception.
	So what can we do, who do we turn to?  Welcome to the Mobile Security page where we can share 
ideas, talk about threats.  This is a page to share new or upcoming countermeasures to mobile threats.  
	I know what you are thinking, what good does it do if I share this information freely so that 
black hat can utilize this information as well?  Valid question, and my response to you would be not to 
fear the black hat, but to show our commitment to mitigating their influence.  They should fear us, 
because we are so willing to share this information so freely with one another.  They should know that we
know their tactics and are willing to stand up in solidarity to prevent even more attacks
