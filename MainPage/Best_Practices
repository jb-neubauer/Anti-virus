	Ever try to employ a new technology, GPO, or anything else to the server, network, or to the
users themselves?  Have you found that the way something is done is tedious?  Have you found a better
way to deploy software or security updates?  Share it here.
	This is the Best Practices page where we want to employ all of the best practices and make our
lives easier and more efficient.  With everyone wanting everything now and some managers wanting 
everything yesterday, the best way for us to stay afloat is to employ best practices especially in 
the ITSec field.  Not only do we have to keep up with management requests but external and internal
influences.  This could be something like the best way to deploy security software to the users.
	Best practices should be something that is fluid and more times than not we (professionals)
do not.  We see them as something set in stone.  I don't think that is the right approach for all 
situations in the ITSec field.  Sometimes the best practices might need to be adjusted for a certain
situation.  
	This is only the platform to discuss current best practices, or what you might believe needs 
to be a best practice.
