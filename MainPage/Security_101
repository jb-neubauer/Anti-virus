	Here we are.  You have found it.  That passion to start learning about Information Security.  
Unfortunately you don't know where to start so you looked here.  Information Security is an ever growing
field and this page will assist in teaching someone who is new to this field a little direction when it
comes to what to know.
	We were all noobs once, so posting how we came from being a noob to where we were now will help
out the next generation of ITSec specialists.  Even if it is something simple, like how to hide files, 
or setting up a GPO to perform a certain action.  These will help out those that want to get into this
field.
	If we train the next generation of ITSec professionals correctly, we might be able to learn 
something as well, even if we have already been exposed to it.
