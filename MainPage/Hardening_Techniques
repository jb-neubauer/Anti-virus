	Have you seen an unsecure website, ever want to make it secure.  Want to harden the site against
attacks?  Show your knowledge in hardening, how would you harden the site, server, network.  For example
If I wanted to harden my webpage against all 128 encryption I would have to make sure that I only allow
AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH under the SSLCipherSuite tag in a conf file.  
	I would go about explaning both the benefit and disadvantage of using only 256 bit encryption
and explane the process to get to that point.
