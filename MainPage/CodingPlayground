Coding Playground

With there being so many ways to improve our skills as professionals.  I think that if we narrow
down on a few of them we might be better in the long run.  I present the Coding Playground.  The idea
is to assist in the troubleshooting of code, users or otherwise.  Every other week I will present
a 'broken' script in a common security programming language like python.  I will intentionally give you
a script that I broke and all of the details needed as to what the script should do and why I want to 
use the script.  The goal is to have you come up with the fix for the script to get it working and 
perhaps present additional measures to make the script even better than it was.  
The broken script might consist of:
Syntax Errors
Grammatical Errors
Scripts that perform other functions than what the intended script was designed to perform
Other errors 
or a combination of any of the above

The goal is to get us to be better at recognizing broken code and ultimately make us better 
troubleshooters.  So join me and have some fun with this.  the best part are these will be available
for use to all if you choose to use them.
