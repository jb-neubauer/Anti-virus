	Have a security related question.  Anything at all.  This is where true collaboration takes 
place.  We should be willing to support one another, and in answering one anothers questions not only
do we make that person that asked the questions smarter, we make ourselves smarter.  
	As something that is answering a question, the goal should be to provide as much information
as possible, that would be the best practice.  It would provide the most accurate information and
the individual that asked the question might not need a follow up.  This is a great place to post any 
security questions.  As someone that is in the field, I always have to do some research each day, either
due to curiosity or the lack of knowledge, and having things in a centralized phace will benefit 
everyone.
	So ask a question even if you think it is a dumb one.  We shouldn't be here to judge but to
assist you in your persuit of knowledge.  The only thing I ask is don't judge us for a question we
might pose that you thing has an obvious answer
