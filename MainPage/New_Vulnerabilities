	Zero Day, DDOS, ARP Poisoning, SQL injections, Ransomware, etc etc.  A few years ago Target was
Affected by a breach where millions of credit cards were compromised.  Incidents like this can happen 
all the time, we need a good outlet to let people know about those threats, breaches, vulnerabilities 
that can cause a lot of harm.
	Post those vulnerabilities here, let people know what is going on, who it is effecting and so on.  Without your voice stating that there is a new threat to look out for, we will all be blindsided.  We 
should let everyone know what is going on and what actions they can take.  This way the number of 
victims from a cyber or security attack is mitigated
