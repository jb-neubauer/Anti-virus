Crossover cables connect 2 like devices together (ethernet)

They have to be on the same network to work together

Router is a 'fancy' PC

Routers have at least 2 NIC's

Routers assign the network interface cards to talk with both sides of a network
that way the network portions match.  This allows devices on the network to 
communicate with one another.  1 IP network to another IP network

Routers allow for routing traffic from one IP network to another IP network

bootup process for router is like a PC.
POST ~ Power on Self Test
Bootstrap ~ Loads set of instructions to call the operating system
IOS ~ This is the OS of the Router 'Internetworking operating system'
Configuration ~ Loads the configurations of the router

memory ~ 
Bootstrap - EEPROM (Electronicaly eraseable programmable Read only Memory)
IOS - Flash (Same as flash USB)
Configuration - NVRAM (Non Volitile Random Access Memory(Stores small files to keep 
The configurations))
Bootstrap ~ .bin file
IOS (stored(flash))~ .bin file
IOS (used(RAM))~ --
Configuration (Stored(NVRAM)) ~ Startup-config
Confifuration (used(RAM)) ~ Running-config

Router Configuration ~ 
Crossover cable from PC to router and a rollover cable to configure the router 
Crossover cable is from the NIC to the FastEthernet 
#Rollover cable from the RS-232 port (serial) to the console port

place an IP on workstation then telnet/ssh into the router to configure it

press enter to start
initial configuration dialog helps to setup router easliy but asks poor questions 
and does them slowly without doing a complete config

press enter to get to the prompt

Cisco default router name is 'ROUTER' 

There are three modes: User, privileged, and cofiguration modes 
within the configuration mode there are both global and sub configuration types

> ~ user mode 

enable ~ allows privilege mode (#)

# indicates privilege mode

privilege mode ~ flush configurations, turn processes on and off, turn things on and 
off, update flash, and move into config mode

Config terminal changes from privilege to config mode ~ Router(config)#

Router(config)# ~ allows you to edit the file running-config

Running-config is stored in Ram

interface fastethernet 0/0 ~ to get to an interface ~ Router(config-if)

exit to get to the previous mode

Three ways to access user mode: Console port on the router, plug a rollover cable into the AUX port, and a virtual connection (VTY port/s) Virtual Terminal lines

to enable so that a password is needed, you must go to ocnfig mode.

To get there type 'enable' then hit enter, then type 'config terminal'

'line' ~ user access mode methods

line console 0 ~ to get to Router(config-line) This allows for things like creating 
a password

IF you don't know you are configuring line console 0 type in 'line console 0' again

to set a password type 'password' and whatever password you want to use ie.
password cisco  ~ this makes the password cisco 

to prompt user mode to require a password when they log in using the console port
type in 'login' ~ This will not prompt for a password because you are in config mode 
and not in user mode

to get from config mode straight to user mode, type 'end' then 'exit'

if there is a message from the router when trying to get from config to user mode
the command you are typing will still take

The above password creation ONLY affects the console port

to set a password for the AUX port to type 'enable' to get to privilege mode 
Then type 'config terminal' to get to config mode 
type 'aux 0' to config the AUX port
type 'password' and whatever password ou want to use ie.
password cisco  ~ this sets the password for the AUX port to 'cisco'
the last thing is to issue the command 'login' to enable a password prompt at the AUX
port when trying to connect to it

then you need to configure the VTY

When in config mode ~ ROUTER(config)# type 'line vty 0 4' This will give 5 virtual
connections

Then set password by typing in 'password' and the password you want to use ie. 
'password cisco' This sets the password for all VTY's (0-4) as cisco, then hit enter
after type login to enable a password prompt for logging into a VTY

'show' command is issued from privilege mode

'show running-config' shows the current running config file.  Hit space to get an
entire page of text, or enter for one line at a time

next is to make it so that usermode to privilege mode requires a PW
to set that up go to 'Router(config)' To get there type in 'enable' and enter
then type in 'config-terminal' to get to terminal
type 'enable secret' and the password you want to use ie.
'enable secret cisco' to make the privelege password cisco

'show run' to show the config file.  

to change the hostname of the router
go to the config mode by typing 'enable' from the user mode to get to privilege
then 'config terminal' to get to config mode
in config mode type 'hostname' then the name you want to change the router to ie.
'hostname Justinrouter' to change the default name to 'Justinrouter'

To set a banner type 'banner' then message with a delimeter ie.
'banner #This router is owned and operated by me#'  The trick for a delimiter is
to pick any character that you aren't going to use in the banner

to configure the IP for fast ethrenet 0/0 be in config mode by typing:
'enable' and hit RETURN to enter privilege mode then 'config terminal' or 'config t'
to get into config mode  'config t' is the shortcut for 'config terminal' when in 
privilege mode

to configure the IP type in 'interface fastethernet 0/0' then hit return
this will allow for the addition of the IP address
to do this type 'ip address' then the address and the mask.  ie. 
'ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0' this configures the IP address on the port

to see the fast ethernet port use 'show interface fastethernet 0/0'  This will 
show the stats of the interface.  this shows 10.0.0.1/24  the 24 represents that
there are 24 bits in the network portion of the IP address.  
Also when seeing this there are three states that the ports can be in:
administratively down: the port is shut down
down: the port is down with the potential to come up if a cable is plugged into it
up: the port is in use

To get a port from administratively down to up you need to be in the config state
then hit 'interface fastethernet 0/0' 
then 'no shutdown' this will bring it to an up state
if I want to go from a down state to an administratively down state 'shutdown'


'show running-config' shows the interface does not have the "no shutdown" command
in the status

'show interface fastethernet 0/0' also shows the state that 0/0 is in

To have the configurations run at startup you must be in privilege mode copy the 
'running-config' file to the 'startup-config' file by running 'copy running-config 
startup-config'
