~netstat~

 display protocol stats and current TCP/IP network connections

-a 
displays active connections

-n 
display addresses and ports in numerical form

-p
allow us to sort out TCP and UDP traffic

netstat -an
displays all active connections in numerical form

only three states 
Listening, time_wait, Established

netstat -an | find established
This displays all active connections in numerical form that are established

nslookup <IP address>
looks up the domain for the IP address you are looking for

netstat -anp 
ex. netstat -anp UDP
displays ports in numerical port, does not show state if connection is UDP

components of an IP address
Network portion and host portion

IP address is made for humans to view, but it is actually in binary when it relates to networking

to identify: 
classful addressing not used 
classful addressing ~ A, B, C, D, E 
A ~ 0.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255  Used for very large Corporations
8 bits in network portion  24 in host
B ~ 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255  
16 bits in network portion 16 in host  used for a larger number of medium sized corp
allows for approx. 65k hosts
C ~ 192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.255
24 bits in the network portion 8 in the host designed for small businesses
only allowed 255 hosts
D ~ 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255
32 bits of network portion. no host portion.  reserved for multicast 
streaming video only for internal companies
E ~ 240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255


classless addressing 
uses subnet mask
in host portion place 1, in host portion place 0 to receive :
ex. 10.0.0.10
subnet mask is 255.0.0.0
it defines the difference between the network and host portion

this can fall anywhere in the 4 octets 
ie.:
10.0.0.0 with the host and network protion split in the second octet creating 
11111111 11111111 11110000 00000000 or 255.255.240.0

network address ~ all 0's in the host portion

broadcast address ~ broadcast to all devices on that network.  all bunary 1's in host portion

host address ~ all numbers in the host between all 0's and all 1's we assign to all network devices in the environment

private and public addresses
most people use a one public addressing scheme for external and for internal use a private network addressing scheme

Network address translation
private address ranges ~ 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255, 172.16.0 0 - 172.32.255.255, 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

NAT takes private and converts it to public

another IP address to know is 127.0.0.1 or the home address (local device) loopback
address

when looking at IP addresses, if more then one default gateway is set, than that 
can cause some major issues.  The IP address card with the default gateway is the 
address currently in use.

ipconfig /all ~ provides more information than regular ipconfig,
This shows a discription, and MAC address, shows whether DHCP is enabled Also shows
DNS servers
