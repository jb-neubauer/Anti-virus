Three security threats

* The first security threat would be XSS or cross side scripting.  This is where an attacker will 
try to injecct their own code into the applications.  Some of the risks include taking over an account,
accessing user information, spreading of viruses, and gaining access to internal systems.  The best
way to prevent this would be to restrict the characters that can be used in the input fields.  This
prevents characters like <,>,/, and any other characters used in scripting.  This would prevent all
scripting that could be done in an input field.  The second thing I would do is to to limit the amount 
of characters that could be entered into the field.  Limiting the field to anything under the typical
amount of characters for an XSS would prevent an XSS from occurring.  

* The second security threat would be SQL injection.  SQL injection, like XSS, will try to insert some
SQL into input fields.  This allows for the attacker to query the database directly.  Common risks
would be data tampering, locking others out of the systems (through becoming an admin for the server)
and spoofing.  To prevent this use whitelist input validation.  This validates all user fields defining
what is Authorized and not allowing everything else.  So if you white list all numbers and letters, 
then the symbols and special characters woudl not be allowed thus preventing any scripts from being 
input.

* The third security threat would be Security misconfiguration.  The reason why this is so important,
just like if your computer is not securely configured, you leave yourself wide open to attacks.  
The thing with application development is ensuring that if there are multiple layers that they are all
secured.  Patching would help ensure the mitigation of threats.  This would help plug any holes in 
current applications and assist in protecting against the latest threats.
