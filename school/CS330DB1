The DBMS I am choosing is MySQL.  This is something I have become familiar with not only within the organization I currently work for but in my everyday life.
The organization I work for relies heavily on MySQL, the main reasons for this is the availability for those to use SQL in the terminal to do so, while others
can use more of a gui based system for SQL they have that option with tools like MySQL workbench.  
The main security features of MySQL are the ability to "GRANT" privileges to users based on their needs.  The GRANT feature defines who can access a database
The connection to the MySQL server can use SSL which uses a PKI system to encrypt data that is being transmitted to and from the MySQL databases.
MySQL can also implement a two-factor aothentication system that requires users who want to log into the MySWL server to have a CA to access the database.
The last thing are the extensive logs that are provided.  These logs show who is accessing the database, any queries that were run and when they left the
database itself.  

The database Schema is the structure that represents a logical view of the entire database.  This defines the how the data is organized and how the relationships
are formed.  This helps programmers understand the database better.  This is helpful becausse in the organization I currently work for, there are many different 
databases used and within each databasee hundreds of not thousands or tens of thousands of tables.  Having the Schema allows anyone making database changes to 
understand fully what the potential effect would have on the rest of the database.
