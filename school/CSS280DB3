Scanning is the process of scannign to see what ports are open.  The ports that are scanned are both TCP and UDP ports.  Scanning allows for hackers to start the 
enumeration process.  Enumeration takes scanning a step further. This is where you discover what processes are running on a system.  This also discovers versions,
details about accounts and possible entry points.  

The pro's of port scanning are that it shows what ports are open.  This will show possible points of attacks from hackers.  Another pro is that the most popular 
tool, nmap, is free and readily available to anyone.  The last pro is also a con as well, knowing that it is available to all means that hackers can utilize the 
tool as well.  Port scanning is a tool that provides a lot of information, and in the worng hands that individual can do a lot of harm to a system.  

Enumeration can be the first step in contact becausee this can describe points of entry for an attack.  If a hacker has this ytpe of infomration and a system is 
not patched, then there are ways already available where they are able to access a system because there are back doors.
