	Nebulous enhanced was created on an idea. That we as sysadmins, cyber specialists, IT personnel,
in general, could collaborate on ideas to prevent cyber attacks.

	I read a post about how we should collaborate with one another to take down cyber threats. That 
is what started my idea, this idea of coming together. And so with that idea came Nebulous Enhanced. A 
place where we can work on being proactive instead of reactive.

	All too often I hear about how someone is the victim of a hacker or a cybercrime itself. It is 
time we get ahead of this epidemic and start to apply a solution instead of a band-aid. They say that 
all people need sometimes is a spark to make a change. Let’s make this spark into a flame. Let’s build 
a better, safer, place to go to for information. Let’s teach the Future to be aware of the security 
needs of the internet and the workings. We have an obligation to pursue not only our safety while we 
surf the net, but the upcoming generations safety as well.

	Let’s band together, pool our resources because every day that goes by where we don’t help to 
secure the internet, it is another day that we put ourselves further behind.
