	We all cannot be serious all the time.  This is where we want to layback and just post anything fun.
This could be anything from pranks to user errors to your own experiences. This also includes nonsense with users.
Though I would prefer them to be IT related, it does not have to.  This is just a place to escape the mundane and laugh.  
	For example, I heard a pretty good prank that was harmless.  Since everyone is using optical mice now,
take sticky notes and sttach them over the optics.  Can you imagine the tickets or lack of tickets if no one 
knows how not to use a mouse.  All the user Frustration that the mouse isn't working, then the frustration/
embarassment when they found out that the entire issue was a sticky not on the bottom of the mouse.
	The idea is to get everyone to have a little fun, even if it at your own expense.  We can't and 
shouldn't be serious all the time, life is too short for that.  We need something fun to help with all the 
negativity in the world.  And besides, who says that collaborations have to be boring, lets make it fun.
